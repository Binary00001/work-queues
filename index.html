    <h1>Bayonetta,</h1>
    <br />
    <p>You are an amazing person.</p>
    <p>You are so incredibly smart and motivated. Your drive motivates people around you. <br />
       You are strong, sometimes stronger than you should ever have to be.
    </p>
    <p>Fuck anyone who says a bad word about you. It just shows how insecure and threatened by you they feel when they believe they have to tear you down to make themselves look "good".
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>Keep being you and the wonderful individual you are. There is no one like you and that is a good thing.
      <br />
